Package: ucx-utils
Architecture: amd64 arm64 ppc64el
Depends: libucx0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Utilities for the UCX messaging library
 Unified Communication X (UCX) provides an optimized communication layer
 for Message Passing (MPI), PGAS/OpenSHMEM libraries and RPC/data-centric 
 applications.
 UCX utilizes high-speed networks for inter-node communication,i
 and shared memory mechanisms for efficient intra-node communication.
 This package provides utilities for the UCX frameworks.
